		<p>This project was created by a team of enthusiastic students and their instructors to provide Software Development students certain guidelines and frameworks surrounding the software development process. The project is the product of research during STEC 4500 courses at Georgia Gwinnett College.</p>
		<p>Students who have created a valuable invention in the course of their study or project have every right to protect their creation whether it is an app, written code, or software idea. As a new invention comes to light, it may not be appealing to let the world know without first considering how to best protect what we have worked so hard to develop. These guidelines hope to inform about the process and options avaliable in protecting software projects.</p>
		<p>Applications for Patents and Copyright can be intimidating and require scrutiny. However, there are other options such as requiring parties to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement. Access to free document contracts can be quite useful. These forms, contracts, and templates were researched, surveyed and collected to be made available on this website for student's use. Easy access to these resources will give students an initial understanding of the legal issues surrounding software project creation as well as how to better protect their rights.</p>
